# hexo-asset-pro
This project was forked from [cnzsb](https://github.com/cnzsb/hexo-asset).

Add new support case : `path/asset.jpg`

Support original markdown image expressions when **enabling `post_asset_folder`**, and no need to use private hexo tags anymore

## Detail

`./path/asset.jpg` and `path/asset.jpg` will be replaced to `your_post_path/asset.jpg`

URLs started with `http`, `https`, `//`, `/` or plain string(`path/asset.jpg`) will keep
